This mini banking app is a HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project that closely mirrors a similiar project made by Jonas Schmedtmann in a Udemy course of his that I purchased and have been using to learn JavaScript. I created this project by means of walking through his lectures regarding array methods. The intent of this project was not to create something wholly new, but rather to become more familiar with JS array methods in order to learn how to better manipulate data using JavaScript.

On the other hand, the code for the create-a-new-account functionality and the modal window was written by me. I also wrote the HTML and CSS with the intent of creating a layout similar in appearance to the Udemy project by Jonas Schmedtmann.

The following is a link to the GitHub folder containing Jonas' original banking application:
